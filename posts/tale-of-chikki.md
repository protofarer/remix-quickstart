# Chikki's Wet Blue Dog

Since she was a child, a wee quiet looker, Chikkiding had a knack for licking. But not just licking. Oh, she did like a good, furry toy in her mouth.

With bits she can tear and patches she can moisten, she loved these plush expendable dolls. And most of all, since she is part cat, it perfectly matched her alter ego (her felineness). One she can bring about and floof about as a reminder to her origin (her canineness).
